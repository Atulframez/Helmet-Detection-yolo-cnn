# 🪖 Helmet Detection System Using YOLOv3 & CNN

This project implements a **helmet detection system** using **computer vision and deep learning**.  
It detects two-wheelers using **YOLOv3** and classifies riders as **Helmet** or **Non-Helmet** using a trained **CNN model**.

Designed for applications like **traffic monitoring**, **road safety enforcement**, and **smart surveillance systems**.
